# Deep-Dive
## Overview
"Deep Dive" is an advanced real-time underwater threat detection and alert system designed to enhance diver safety and foster a community of knowledge sharing. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies such as OpenCV and YOLO for object detection, paired with a full-stack development approach using React for the front-end and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the back-end.

## Key Features
Real-Time Underwater Threat Detection: Utilizes computer vision technologies like OpenCV and YOLO to identify and classify potential underwater threats in real time, ensuring divers are alerted promptly.
User-Friendly Interface: The front-end is built with React, providing an intuitive platform where researchers and divers can easily upload, access, and share their latest underwater findings.
Knowledge Sharing: Designed to act as a comprehensive educational resource, Deep Dive allows users to contribute data, fostering collaboration and enhancing diver awareness about potential hazards.
Secure and Scalable Back-End: Built with Node.js and Express, the back-end infrastructure is designed to handle large volumes of data while maintaining robust security measures, ensuring the platform remains a trusted resource for researchers.
Community Building: Through seamless integration with MongoDB, the platform supports a growing community of divers and researchers, facilitating knowledge exchange and discussions about underwater safety.

## Purpose
The main objective of "Deep Dive" is to enhance diver safety by integrating technology into underwater exploration. By providing a platform where researchers can share their findings and insights, the project creates a learning hub for novice and experienced divers alike, helping them stay informed about potential threats and best practices.

## Future Improvements
Enhanced Threat Detection Accuracy: Continuous updates to the YOLO model to improve the accuracy of underwater object detection.
Mobile Integration: Development of a mobile app to extend the platformâ€™s accessibility to divers on the go.
Machine Learning Enhancements: Future iterations could incorporate machine learning to predict potential threats based on environmental data and historical patterns.
